## Description

The neural network used to train the neural network to play Snake uses a combination of reinforcement learning and deep q learning to train the neural network. Additionally, live statistics (score and collision count) are recorded and displayed alongside the training of the neural network.

### Technologies / Packages

- Python
    - **pyGame**
    
        Used to build the Snake game itself.
    - **pyTorch**

        Used to develop and train the neural network.
    - **numPy**

        Used for vector manipulation to train the neural network
    - **matplotlib**

        Used to plot the live statistics of the neural network, which includes **score**, **mean score** and **collison count**.
